    <p>Dear Detective <span class="blurred">Dewdrop</span>,<br> <span class="blurred">Crystal Lake </span>has been polluted. This sacred water source is what keeps our valley vibrant and thriving.</p>
    <p>We suspect that <span class="blurred">Baron Blackwater</span> is responsible for this. He has hidden the cause in his underground fortress. Your mission is to infiltrate the fortress and neutralize the pollution before it's irreversible.</p>
    <p>Be sure to keep the fortress’s location confidential. Any leak of this information could endanger the entire operation.</p>
